## 🧠 REVIEWER PSYCHOLOGY - "Uncle Questions" & Your Answers

### Q: "Why not just use Excel?"
**A**: "Sir, Excel can't automatically calculate dosha compatibility or suggest seasonal food alternatives. Our system has 2000+ food items with Ayurvedic properties encoded."

### Q: "How do I know this follows real Ayurveda?"
**A**: "We've digitized classical texts like Charaka Samhita. Every recommendation shows the underlying principle - Vata/Pitta/Kapha balance with scientific reasoning."

### Q: "What if internet goes down?"
**A**: "Progressive Web App works offline. Critical patient data cached locally, syncs when connection returns."

### Q: "How much will this cost hospitals?"
**A**: "Saves 2-3 hours per doctor daily. At ₹500/hour, that's ₹1000+ daily savings per doctor. Our solution pays for itself in a week."
